Analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragment size patterns, known as fragmentomics, is a rapidly advancing field for non-invasive cancer detection. While traditional approaches focus on local features like binned histograms, which are valuable but incomplete, our work introduces a deep learning framework, named as FragNet, built on a more holistic principle.
