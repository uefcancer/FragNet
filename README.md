Analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragment size patterns, known as fragmentomics, is a rapidly advancing field for non-invasive cancer detection. While traditional approaches focus on local features like binned histograms, which are valuable but incomplete, our work introduces a deep learning framework, named as FragNet, built on a more holistic principle.


# How to run demo code which reads feature files and perform cancer detection:

1. Upload both classifier_demo_code.ipynb file and review_data_sample.csv to the Google Colab environment for the code to run.
2. Directly open the Google Colab link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HPnQRI_FMO2QRvGoE2EKZd-xwVtimcb6
